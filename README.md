# Text Complexity

This collection of R scripts is aimed at calculating a number of metrics that approximate the "complexity" of literary texts, and using them as features in stylometrical analysis. Still very much work-in-progress.

### Dependencies

- Some functions from https://github.com/pielstroem/myRscripts
- the 'stylo' R package
